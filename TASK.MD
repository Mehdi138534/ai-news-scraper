# üì∞ Test Assignment: News Scraping & AI Analysis

## üéØ Objective
This project is designed to assess your **problem-solving skills** and ability to quickly learn and apply new technologies, specifically **Generative AI (GenAI)**. You will develop a solution that extracts news articles from provided URLs, generates summaries and identifies topics using GenAI tools.

## üìã Task Description

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ News Extraction
- Develop a script to **scrape news articles** from provided URLs
- Ensure the extracted content captures the **full text and headline** of the articles

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ GenAI-driven Summarization and Topic Identification
- Use a **GenAI platform or tool** (e.g., OpenAI's GPT models, or any other LLM) to analyze the articles
- Generate a **concise summary** that captures key points
- Identify the **main topics** of each article
- Focus on **effectively integrating and utilizing GenAI tools** rather than building from scratch

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Semantic Search with GenAI
- Store the extracted news, their GenAI-generated summaries, and topics in a **vector database**
- Implement a **semantic search feature** leveraging GenAI tools to interpret and find relevant articles based on user queries
- This search should **understand the context** of the queries and match them effectively with the summaries and topics
- Search should handle **semantically close search terms** like synonyms

## üìö Requirements
- Implement the solution using **Python**. Relevant libraries might include Langchain, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel, or others
- The solution should be **clean, well-structured, and properly documented**
- Provide a **GitHub repository** link containing all source code and a readme file with instructions on setting up and running your prototype

## ‚≠ê Evaluation Criteria
- **Creativeness and efficiency** in using GenAI tools for summarization and topic identification
- **Clarity and quality** of code documentation
- **Overall functionality** and creativity of the solution
