# AI News Scraper & Semantic Search with GenAI - Comprehensive PRD

## Project Overview

### Objective
Develop a Python application that combines web scraping, GenAI, and vector search technologies to provide an intelligent news article management system. This project demonstrates problem-solving skills and ability to integrate Generative AI tools for real-world applications.

### Core Features
- Scrapes full news articles (headline + body) from provided URLs using newspaper3k and BeautifulSoup4
- Uses GenAI (OpenAI GPT models) to generate concise article summaries (100-300 words) and extract relevant topics
- Stores content and metadata in a vector database (FAISS/Qdrant/Pinecone) for semantic search
- Implements semantic search with hybrid capabilities for intelligent article retrieval
- Provides multiple interfaces: Streamlit UI, CLI, and Python API
- Supports offline mode with local models for development or air-gapped environments
- Offers containerized deployment for easy setup and scalability
