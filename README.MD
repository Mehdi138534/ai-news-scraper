```

3. List all articles:

```bash
poetry run python cli.py list
```

4. Clear the database:

```bash
poetry run python cli.py clear
```

#### Using the main module directly

You can also use the main module directly:

1. Process news articles:

```bash
# Process URLs directly
poetry run python -m src.main process --urls https://example.com/news1 https://example.com/news2

# Process URLs from a file
poetry run python -m src.main process --file urls.txt
```

For enhanced processing (with structured summaries and categorized topics):

```bash
# Enhanced processing with direct URLs
poetry run python -m src.main process --urls https://example.com/news1 --enhanced

# Enhanced processing with URLs from a file
poetry run python -m src.main process --file urls.txt --enhanced
```

2. Search for articles:

```bash
poetry run python -m src.main search "your search query" --limit 5
```

3. List all articles:

```bash
poetry run python -m src.main list
```

4. Clear the database:

```bash
poetry run python -m src.main clear
```

### Python Module

You can also use the application programmatically:

```python
from src.main import NewsScraperPipeline

# Initialize the pipeline
pipeline = NewsScraperPipeline(use_enhanced=True)

# Process URLs
urls = ["https://example.com/news1", "https://example.com/news2"]
result = pipeline.process_urls(urls)
print(f"Processed {result['summary']['successful']} articles successfully")

# Search for articles
results = pipeline.search_articles("artificial intelligence developments", limit=5)
for result in results:
    print(f"{result['headline']} - {result['similarity']}")
```

Alternatively, you can start the application manually:

```bash
# Run with Poetry
poetry run streamlit run src/ui/app.py

# Or with regular Python
streamlit run src/ui/app.py
```

This will open a browser window with the application interface, where you can:

- Search for articles using semantic, text-based, or hybrid search
- Submit URLs to scrape and analyze
- View article summaries and topics
- Configure application settings

### Command Line Interface

#### Using the dedicated CLI script

The project includes a user-friendly CLI script (`cli.py`) that provides a more interactive experience:

1. Process news articles:

```bash
# With Poetry - Process URLs directly
poetry run python cli.py process --urls https://example.com/news1 https://example.com/news2

# Process URLs from a text file (one URL per line)
poetry run python cli.py process --file urls.txt

# Without Poetry
python cli.py process --urls https://example.com/news1 https://example.com/news2
```

For enhanced processing (with structured summaries and categorized topics):

```bash
# Enhanced processing with direct URLs
poetry run python cli.py process --urls https://example.com/news1 --enhanced

# Enhanced processing with URLs from a file
poetry run python cli.py process --file urls.txt --enhanced
```

2. Search for articles:

```bash
poetry run python cli.py search "artificial intelligence developments" --limit 5
```

3. List all articles:

```bash
poetry run python cli.py list
```

4. Clear the database:

```bash
poetry run python cli.py clear
```

#### Using the main module directly

You can also use the main module directly:

1. Process news articles:

```bash
# Process URLs directly
poetry run python -m src.main process --urls https://example.com/news1 https://example.com/news2

# Process URLs from a file
poetry run python -m src.main process --file urls.txt
```

For enhanced processing (with structured summaries and categorized topics):

```bash
# Enhanced processing with direct URLs
poetry run python -m src.main process --urls https://example.com/news1 --enhanced

# Enhanced processing with URLs from a file
poetry run python -m src.main process --file urls.txt --enhanced
```

2. Search for articles:

```bash
poetry run python -m src.main search "your search query" --limit 5
```

3. List all articles:

```bash
poetry run python -m src.main list
```

4. Clear the database:

```bash
poetry run python -m src.main clear
```

### Python Module

You can also use the application programmatically:

```python
from src.main import NewsScraperPipeline

# Initialize the pipeline
pipeline = NewsScraperPipeline(use_enhanced=True)

# Process URLs
urls = ["https://example.com/news1", "https://example.com/news2"]
result = pipeline.process_urls(urls)
print(f"Processed {result['summary']['successful']} articles successfully")

# Search for articles
results = pipeline.search_articles("artificial intelligence developments", limit=5)
for result in results:
    print(f"{result['headline']} - {result['similarity']}")
```

### Docker Deployment

The application can be easily deployed using Docker:

```bash
# Build and start the application using docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# Access the web UI at http://localhost:8501
```

You can customize the deployment by editing the `docker-compose.yml` file to:
- Configure environment variables
- Enable additional vector database services (e.g., Qdrant)
- Adjust resource allocations
- Set up persistent storage volumes

For a quick test, you can also run just the Docker container:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t news-scraper .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env news-scraper
```

### Offline Mode

The application includes comprehensive offline mode functionality:

1. **Command Line**: Use the `--offline` flag
   ```bash
   poetry run python cli.py process --urls https://example.com/news1 --offline
   ```

2. **Web UI**: Toggle the "Offline Mode" checkbox in the sidebar

3. **Python Module**: Set `offline_mode=True` when initializing
   ```python
   pipeline = NewsScraperPipeline(config=Config(offline_mode=True))
   ```

In offline mode, the application:
- Uses **Sentence Transformers** for local text embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- Employs **extractive summarization** using NLTK instead of OpenAI
- Performs **keyword-based topic extraction** using NLTK's part-of-speech tagging
- Uses **text-based search** with TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- Requires **no internet connection** for core functionality
- Provides **graceful degradation** with slightly reduced quality

The offline mode is particularly useful for:
- Development and testing without API costs
- Running in environments without internet access
- Privacy-sensitive applications where data must remain local
- Building proof-of-concepts and demonstrations

## üß™ Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
# With Poetry (recommended)
poetry run pytest

# Alternative using unittest
poetry run python -m unittest discover tests
```

Run specific test file:

```bash
# With Poetry (recommended)
poetry run pytest tests/test_scraper.py

# Alternative using unittest
poetry run python -m unittest tests.test_scraper
```

Run tests with coverage report:

```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=src tests/
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Design Patterns

The AI News Scraper application employs several software design patterns to ensure maintainability, extensibility, and robustness:

1. **Pipeline Pattern**
   - The core architecture follows a data processing pipeline pattern
   - Each stage (scraping, summarizing, topic extraction, embedding) can be executed independently
   - Data flows through the pipeline with clear input/output interfaces

2. **Strategy Pattern**
   - Interchangeable algorithms for summarization and topic extraction
   - Runtime selection between online (GPT) and offline (local) strategies
   - Implementation abstracted behind clear interfaces

3. **Factory Pattern**
   - Vector store instantiation via the `get_vector_store()` factory function
   - Dynamic backend selection based on configuration
   - Consistent interface across different implementations

4. **Repository Pattern**
   - Abstract data access behind the `VectorStore` base class
   - Consistent API for storing and retrieving embeddings
   - Implementation details isolated from business logic

5. **Adapter Pattern**
   - OpenAI and local model interfaces standardized
   - Seamless switching between different backends
   - Consistent error handling across adapters

### Embedding Process

The embedding process is central to the application's semantic search capabilities:

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Document segmentation for large articles
   - Removal of irrelevant content and noise
   - Normalization of text for consistency

2. **Embedding Generation**
   - OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model (online mode)
   - Sentence Transformers' all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (offline mode)
   - Dimensionality: 1536 dimensions (OpenAI) / 384 dimensions (Sentence Transformers)

3. **Metadata Association**
   - Embedding vectors stored with rich metadata
   - Enables filtering and post-processing of results
   - Allows reconstruction of original content

4. **Index Management**
   - FAISS: Local disk-based index with IVF (Inverted File) for performance
   - Qdrant: Vector database with filtering capabilities
   - Pinecone: Cloud-based scalable vector search

### Natural Language Processing Techniques

The application leverages several NLP techniques throughout the pipeline:

1. **Article Extraction**
   - DOM analysis with newspaper3k
   - Content cleaning and normalization
   - Boilerplate removal

2. **Summarization**
   - Abstractive: OpenAI GPT models (online)
   - Extractive: Sentence scoring with TF-IDF (offline)
   - Structured output with key points in enhanced mode

3. **Topic Extraction**
   - Prompt engineering for GPT-based extraction (online)
   - POS tagging and noun phrase extraction (offline)
   - Topic normalization against predefined categories

4. **Semantic Search**
   - Vector similarity using cosine distance
   - Re-ranking with text-based matching for hybrid search
   - Query expansion for improved results

### Performance Optimizations

Several optimizations have been implemented to improve performance:

1. **Batch Processing**
   - Article embeddings generated in batches
   - Reduces API call overhead
   - Improves throughput for large datasets

2. **Caching**
   - Embedding results cached to avoid redundant computation
   - URL-based content hashing to detect changes
   - In-memory cache for frequently accessed items

3. **Parallel Processing**
   - Concurrent article scraping
   - Asynchronous API calls where applicable
   - Progress tracking with tqdm

4. **Index Optimization**
   - FAISS index trained on document corpus
   - Quantization for reduced memory footprint
   - Disk-based persistence for large datasets

### Error Handling Strategy

The application implements a robust error handling strategy:

1. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Pipeline continues despite individual component failures
   - Default values provided for missing data
   - Quality indicators for imperfect results

2. **Retry Logic**
   - Configurable retry attempts for network operations
   - Exponential backoff for API rate limiting
   - Circuit breaker for persistent failures

3. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - Structured logs with context
   - Performance metrics and timing data
   - Error aggregation and reporting

4. **User Feedback**
   - Clear error messages in UI
   - Status indicators for long-running operations
   - Suggestions for resolving common issues
