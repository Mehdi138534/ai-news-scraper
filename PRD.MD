| Requirement ID | Description                                      | User Story                                                                                                           | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001          | Extracting News Articles                        | As a user, I want the system to fetch full news articles from provided URLs so that I can process and store them.   | The system should scrape the article's headline and full text and return structured data for each URL provided.                                                   |
| FR002          | Summarizing News Articles                       | As a user, I want the system to summarize the articles so I can quickly understand the key points of each one.      | The system should use a GenAI model to generate concise, informative summaries for each scraped article.                                                          |
| FR003          | Identifying Topics in Articles                  | As a user, I want the system to identify main topics of each article so I can categorize and search them effectively.| The system should extract and list key topics or keywords relevant to each article using a GenAI tool.                                                            |
| FR004          | Storing Data in a Vector Database               | As a developer, I want to store articles, summaries, and topics in a vector DB to enable fast semantic search.      | The system should generate embeddings and save them along with metadata (URL, headline, summary, topics) in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Qdrant).    |
| FR005          | Semantic Search Feature                         | As a user, I want to search articles semantically using natural language queries so I can find relevant content.     | The system should convert user queries to embeddings, perform similarity searches in the vector DB, and return the top relevant articles.                         |
| FR006          | Handling Synonyms and Context in Search         | As a user, I want the search to understand synonyms and context so that I get meaningful results.                   | The semantic search should match conceptually similar queries and article content (e.g., "AI" and "Artificial Intelligence" are treated as the same topic).       |
| FR007          | Robust Error Handling for Scraping              | As a developer, I want the system to handle scraping errors gracefully so that the pipeline is stable.              | The system should implement retries, log errors, and skip invalid or unreachable URLs while continuing processing.                                                 |
| FR008          | API Key Management and Security                 | As a developer, I want to manage API keys securely so the system is safe from unauthorized use.                     | The system should load API keys from environment variables and ensure they are not hardcoded or exposed in logs.                                                   |
| FR009          | Local Development Setup                         | As a developer, I want clear setup instructions so I can run the app locally.                                       | The repository should include a `README.md` detailing environment setup, dependencies, and how to run the full pipeline end-to-end.                               |
| FR010          | Testing                                         | As a developer, I want to test the system's modules to ensure each component works as expected.                     | The project should include unit tests and integration tests covering scraping, summarization, topic extraction, and semantic search modules.                      |
| FR011          | Python 3.12 Compatibility                       | As a developer, I want the application to use Python 3.12 so it leverages the latest language features.            | All code should be compatible with Python 3.12 and take advantage of its features where appropriate.                                                              |
| FR012          | Poetry Dependency Management                    | As a developer, I want to use Poetry for dependency management so the project has reproducible builds.              | The project should use Poetry for dependency management, with a complete `pyproject.toml` file defining all dependencies and development requirements.            |
